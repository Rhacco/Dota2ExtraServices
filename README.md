# *** IMPORTANT UPDATE 2023 :) ***

This project is fully inactive. It used to be part of [Rhacco/DotaSccop](https://github.com/Rhacco/DotaScoop) to serve extra data not directly available from the Steam Web API. So basically, I built my own Web API by regularly parsing Steam's Web API on my own remote server, then provided extra packages of data that my Android app needed and requested via the internet. Pretty cool experience!

# Dota2ExtraServices
Additional Dota 2 services not directly available in the Steam Web API.
